# Final project for the 'Clustering Algorithms' Course

The instructions for the assignment are in [this file](Project.pdf) and my report is [this file](report.pdf).

The following are the required data and workspaces:

1. data_overview.mat
2. Labels_Salinas.mat
3. preprocessed_X.mat
4. Salinas_Data.mat

The following functions were created by me:

1. calc_eta.m
2. corr_coeff_plot.m
3. eucledian_distance.m
4. feature_space_reduction.m
5. fuzzy_c means.m
6. pca_plot.m
7. plot_lifespans.m
8. plotPCAClusters.m
9. possibi_cost.m
10. probabi_m
11. probabi_cost.m

The following scripts and live scripts were created by me and were used in all the analyses
mentioned above:

1. data overview.m
2. inspect_spectral_information.mlx
3. preprocess.m
4. results_overview.mlx
5. testing_CL.m
6. testing_fuzzy.m
7. testing_k means.m
8. testing_possibi.m
9. testing_probabi.m
10. testing_Ward.m
11. testing_WPGMA.m

The following functions were taken from the GitHub repository [Introduction to Pattern
Recognition a Matlab Approach](https://github.com/pikrakis/Introduction-to-Pattern-Recognition-a-Matlab-Approach/tree/master) or were provided in the course materials:

1. distan.m
2. distant_init.m
3. k_means.m
4. pca_fun.m
5. possibi.m

The following functions were taken from two GitHub repositories and were used for calcu-
lating the scoring metrics (ARI, RI, HI, MI, and NMI):

1. Contingency.m
   from:
   https://github.com/areslp/matlab/blob/master/code_cospectral/Contingency.m
2. NMI.m
   from:
   https://github.com/PRML/PRMLT/blob/master/chapter01/nmi.m
3. RandIndex.m
   from:
   https://github.com/areslp/matlab/blob/master/code_cospectral/RandIndex.m
